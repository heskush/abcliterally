All the different variations of pattern searching arise from two basic different ways to search for a pattern.
1. Preprocessing Text: This gives a time complexity of every search to be O(M) where M is the size of the patter. But the preprocessing of the text takes time and the preprocessed text takes extra space. This is useful when the text is static. e.g. Tries.
2. Preprocessing  keys: This gives a time complexity of every search to be O(N) where N is the size of the text in which the search is to be made.
