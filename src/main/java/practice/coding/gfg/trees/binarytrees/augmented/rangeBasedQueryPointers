All the different variations of data structures for providing range based queries arise due to the different
 trade-offs between space complexity and time complexity of various operations like query and point or range
 update. For e.g. the various options available for range minimum queries (RMQ) like segment tree, 2-D minima
 array , sparse table, square root decomposition and binary indexed tree are different in their complexities
 and this difference should always be kept in mind when trying to solve a problem involving range based queries.
