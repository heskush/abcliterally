1. A complete binary tree is a binary tree where each level ‘l’ except the last has 2^l nodes
and the nodes at the last level are all left aligned.
2. Complete binary trees are mainly used in heap based data structures.
3. The nodes in the complete binary tree are inserted from left to right in one level at a time.
4. If a level is full, the node is inserted in a new level.
5.Complete binary trees are generally represented using arrays. The array representation is better because it doesn’t contain any empty
 slot. Given parent index i, its left child is given by 2 * i + 1 and its right child is given by 2 * i + 2. So no extra space is
 wasted and space to store left and right pointers is saved.
